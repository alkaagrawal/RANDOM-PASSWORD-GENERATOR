# RANDOM-PASSWORD-GENERATOR


A random password generator is a software program, hardware device, or online tool that automatically generates a password using parameters that a user sets, including mixed-case letters, numbers, symbols, pronounceability, length, and strength.

In the project, it generates two 15-length random passwords after you click on the Generate Passwords button.
